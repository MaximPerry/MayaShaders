# MayaShaders
Maya is a shaderpack that focuses on cutting edge graphics while focusing on compatibility. 

As a longtime user of [SEUS PTGI](https://www.sonicether.com/seus/), I launched this initiative as I've been wanting to play with a shaderpack that looks as great while also being compatible with all modern graphics card and with Distance Horizon, on any OS. 

I come from a web developper background (JavaScript, PHP), so this will be my first shader development experience. As I am starting this project, I have no previous experience coding in GLSL or OpenGL. I remain however eager and determined to learn and develop this shader. I thank you all for your patience while I get there. 

I also intend on creating my own tutorial on Shaders development as I get there. While I am greateful of the existing ones, I find them difficult to follow for someone with no previous experience.
